# The Alpine Image Builder Builder

This is a simple form to help generate a custom mkimg profile for use with Alpine Linux's Custom ISO builder. It is based on the [wiki](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/How_to_make_a_custom_ISO_image_with_mkimage), [Cinemint's tech tips video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGxxxABAl9s&t=790s), and the [aports source code](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/tree/master/scripts).

## Is this up to date?

This repo has a GH action that runs every night to check the aports/scripts directory for changes. If there are changes, an issue will be created to notify me. I will then make any necessary updates to this repo.

## How to use

Simply navigate to the [form](http://mkimg.hostpi.io/) and fill it out! The last page will provide you with a generated profile for you to use.
